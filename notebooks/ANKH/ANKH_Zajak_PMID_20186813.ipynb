    "vignette=\"\"\"A 6-year-old male patient was initially evaluated in the Pediatric Plastic Surgery \n",
    "clinic for a progressively worsening facial deformity. He was born at full term by spontaneous \n",
    "vaginal delivery without prenatal or perinatal complications. His birth weight was 3.3 kg (∼35th centile) \n",
    "and his birth length was 45 cm (∼3rd centile). At 6 years, his height was 118 cm (∼65th centile) and \n",
    "his weight was 19 kg (∼25th centile); at 9 years, his height was 138 cm (∼75th centile) and his weight \n",
    "was 28.5 kg (∼50th centile). Clinically, he presented with a small nose, \n",
    "a wide and thickened bony nasal bridge, and prominent zygomatic arches (Fig 1A). \n",
    "Computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the skull showed multiple hyperostoses in the occipital calvarium, \n",
    "maxilla, mandible, and nasal bones, and bilateral obliteration of the maxillary sinus and \n",
    "mastoid air cells (data not shown). The patient presented with no apparent signs of middle ear dysfunction, \n",
    "sensorineural hearing loss, or vision loss. This was determined by tympanometry (Type A on both sides), \n",
    "pure tone audiometric air and bone conduction tests (0-15 dB at 250-8k Hz on both ears), \n",
    "speech audiometry (SRT of 8 dB on both ears), and visual acuity test (scored 20/20 for both eyes) \n",
    "performed at 9 years. The patient was in good overall health as well. A lateral radiograph of the \n",
    "patient's ankle showed mild broadening of the tibial metaphyseal plate (Fig 1B). A lateral \n",
    "radiograph of the skull, taken at 9 years (Fig 1C), also showed that \n",
    "the mineral density and thickness of the endosteal bony plate was significantly increased \n",
    "in the cranial vault and mandibular symphysis (Fig 1C). Dental records indicated that the \n",
    "patient's primary teeth were smaller than average and discolored. \n",
    "In a panoramic radiograph at 9 years, most of the primary teeth showed no root resorption nor delayed \n",
    "exfoliation, and further, the radiograph indicates that the permanent teeth were developing \n",
    "normally (Fig 1D). The alveolar bone showed significantly increased mineral density and \n",
    "a lack of typical trabecular bony architecture (Fig 1D). The patient's parents and \n",
    "sibling had no evident features similar to those observed in the patient, although \n",
    "they were not formally examined. Based on the clinical and radiographic examinations, \n",
    "the patient was given a clinical diagnosis of a sporadic form of craniometaphyseal dysplasia.\"\"\""
