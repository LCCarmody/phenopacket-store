This script is designed to create phenopackets representing the patients with Metachondromatosis due to variants in the PTPN11 gene as described in the publication: 
Bowen ME, et al. (2011) Loss-of-function mutations in PTPN11 cause metachondromatosis, but not Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome. PLoS Genet. 7(4):e1002050. 

To run the script, perform the following steps
```
python3 -m venv ptpn11
source ptpn11/bin/activate
pip install phenopackets 
pip install pyphetools
