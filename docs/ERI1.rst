ERI1

Variants in the `ERI1 gene <https://omim.org/entry/608739 >`_
were shown by `Guo L, et al. (2023) <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37352860/>`_
to be associated with bi-allelic ERI1 variants by reporting eight affected individuals 
from seven unrelated families. A severe spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) was identified in 
five affected individuals with missense variants but not in those with bi-allelic null variants, 
who showed mild intellectual disability.

These conditions were not listed in OMIM at the time of this writing (July 8, 2023).
