This repository contains a collection of notebooks that generate 
`GA4GH phenopackets <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35705716>`
for analysis projects. The phenopackets represent case reports about
individuals with Mendelian diseases.

The notebooks are contained in the ``notebooks`` folder organized according to gene.

The corresponding phenopackets are stored in the ``phenpackets`` subfolder, also organized according to 
gene.

There is one short documentation page for each gene that summarizes the available data.
