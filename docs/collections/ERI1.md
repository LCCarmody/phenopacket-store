were investigated by [Guo L, et al. (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37352860/){:target="_blank"}
A severe spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) was identified in
five affected individuals with missense variants but not in those with bi-allelic null variants,
who showed mild intellectual disability.

These conditions were not listed in OMIM at the time of this writing (July 8, 2023).
